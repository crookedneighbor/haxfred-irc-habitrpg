haxfred-irc-habitrpg
====================

IRC adaptor for habitrpg (to be used in conjunction with upvote adaptor)


###Example JSon config for users
```
{ 
	ircUser1 : [user1-ID, user1-API],
	ircUser2 : [user2-ID, user2-API]
}
```

###Todo's
* User ID and API should not be in the config file (IE, something that might be pushed to a github repo). Maybe config would be the path to a file?
* Make id name configurable
